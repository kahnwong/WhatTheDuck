WhatTheDuck is an open-source web application built on DuckDB, designed to allow users to upload CSV files, store them
in tables, and perform SQL queries on the uploaded data. The application also provides the functionality to download
filtered results in CSV format, supports uploading multiple files, and enables users to perform join queries. It's
important to note that the application stores data temporarily in memory, and refreshing the page will clear all
uploaded data.
